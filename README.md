If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

git clone https://github.com/Bharath-serman/PortFolio
```
## Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.

```

## Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.

npm run dev
```
## Step 5: Run the backend server after filling the placeholders for nodemailer.

node server.js
```
